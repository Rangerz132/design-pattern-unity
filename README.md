# Unity Design Patterns

This repository contains a collection of design patterns implemented in Unity. Each pattern is defined, along with its advantages and disadvantages, to help you understand their applications and implications in game development.

## Design Patterns Overview

### 1. Command Pattern

**Definition:**  
The Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.

**Advantages:**

- Decouples the sender and receiver of requests.
- Enables undoable operations.
- Simplifies complex command sequences.

**Disadvantages:**

- Can lead to a large number of command classes.
- Increases complexity in some cases, particularly with extensive command histories.

---

### 2. Composite Pattern

**Definition:**  
The Composite pattern composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It allows clients to treat individual objects and composites uniformly.

**Advantages:**

- Simplifies client code by allowing them to use the same interface for individual and composite objects.
- Promotes flexibility in adding new components.

**Disadvantages:**

- Can make the design more complicated by introducing numerous component classes.
- May lead to a performance overhead due to the recursive nature of operations.

### 3. Observer Pattern

**Definition:**  
The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

**Advantages:**

- Promotes loose coupling between subjects and observers.
- Easily allows for dynamic subscription and unsubscription of observers.

**Disadvantages:**

- Can lead to memory leaks if observers are not properly unregistered.
- Difficulty in understanding the flow of notifications in complex systems.

### 4. Pool Pattern

**Definition:**  
The Pool pattern manages the allocation and deallocation of resources, typically for objects that are expensive to create and destroy.

**Advantages:**

- Reduces overhead by reusing objects, improving performance.
- Helps manage resource allocation more effectively.

**Disadvantages:**

- May introduce complexity in managing the pool.
- Requires careful handling of object lifecycle to avoid issues.

### 5. Proxy Pattern

**Definition:**  
The Proxy pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. This can be useful for lazy initialization, access control, logging, etc.

**Advantages:**

- Can enhance performance through lazy loading.
- Provides a way to add additional functionality without modifying the original object.

**Disadvantages:**

- Introduces another layer of abstraction, which may complicate the system.
- May impact performance if overused or improperly implemented.

---

### 6. Singleton Pattern

**Definition:**  
The Singleton pattern restricts a class to a single instance and provides a global point of access to it.

**Advantages:**

- Ensures a single instance of a class, providing a controlled access point.
- Simplifies access to shared resources.

**Disadvantages:**

- Global state can lead to tight coupling and make testing difficult.
- Can be misused to create hidden dependencies in code.

---

### 7. State Pattern

**Definition:**  
The State pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

**Advantages:**

- Encapsulates state-specific behavior, simplifying code.
- Reduces the need for complex conditionals and state management.

**Disadvantages:**

- Can lead to a proliferation of small classes for each state.
- Complexity may increase if state transitions are not carefully managed.

---

### 8. Strategy Pattern

**Definition:**  
The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.

**Advantages:**

- Promotes the use of composition over inheritance, enhancing flexibility.
- Makes it easy to add new strategies without altering existing code.

**Disadvantages:**

- Increased number of classes can complicate the codebase.
- Requires careful management of context objects and strategy assignments.

---

### 8. Factory Pattern

**Definition:**  
The Factory Pattern is used to create objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created. It focuses on a single product type and its creation logic.

**Advantages:**

- Decouples the object creation process from the code that uses the objects.
- Allows for easy addition of new product types without changing existing code.

**Disadvantages:**

- Can lead to an increase in the number of factory classes.
- May complicate code structure if overused.

## Conclusion

These design patterns provide robust solutions to common problems in game development, enhancing maintainability, scalability, and code organization. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each pattern will help you implement them effectively in your Unity projects.
